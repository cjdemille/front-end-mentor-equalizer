## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My main focus here was on the responsive css design and ensuring that the page was mobile-first. 

### Continued development

I definitely think the "Premium EQ" section layout can be improved. I'm working on fine tuning my css skills to more precisely replicate the source material.
